# Computational-Statistical-Mechanics-Projects

In my junior year of my physics degree, I spent two semesters working on computational projects in the field of statistical mechanics. The two projects that I worked on were both using the Metropolis Algorithm in order to find ground state energies of systems. The two systems I modeled were the Ising model of the ferromagnet as well as phases of gases, liquids, and solids.
